# In our example above, we used Darts to obtain once a forecast over the next 36 months starting 
# in January 1958. However, forecasts often need to be updated as soon as new data becomes available. 
# With Darts, itâ€™s easy to compute the forecasts resulting from such a process, using backtesting. 
# For instance, using backtesting to compare two models looks as follows:

models = [ExponentialSmoothing(), AutoARIMA()] # , Prophet()
backtests = [model.historical_forecasts(series,
                            start=.5,
                            forecast_horizon=3)
